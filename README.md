# nes-emu

This is my work-in-progress NES Emulator project. It is not yet in a working state.

I am currently developing on MacOS with the intention to port to Raspbian once everything is working.

For MacOS, dependencies are OpenGL and PortAudio.

To build, clone the repo and do `make mac` or `make pi` to build.
